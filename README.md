## AIM:
 Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).
 #

1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

Identify user pain points.
Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template:
"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods

Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies).
Justify your method choice.
 3. Creating Personas

 Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.

Create at least two user personas with:
Demographics
Goals
Behaviors
Pain points
Motivations
## Scenario 1: Health App for Medication Reminders  
# Problem Statements  
# Problem 1: # 
"Elderly users need a way to remember to take their medicine because they often forget or 
get confused about the timing, which results in missed doses and health issues."    
## Problem 2:  
"Caregivers need a way to track their family member’s medication because they cannot 
always be present, which results in stress and lack of updates."  
## Research Methods  
• Interviews – to understand how older users and caregivers currently manage 
medications and what they find hard.  
• Usability Testing – to check if users can easily use the reminder app and understand how to set medication alarms.  
# Why?  
Interviews give real, personal stories. Usability testing shows if users get confused or lost when using the app.  
# Personas  
# Persona 1: Elderly User

• Goals: Stay healthy and take medicine on time  
• Behaviours: Uses a basic phone, asks his son for help with apps

## Scenario 2: E-commerce App for Eco-Friendly Products  
## Problem Statements  
## Problem 1:  
"Eco-conscious shoppers need a way to find sustainable products easily because regular 
shopping apps don’t show eco-friendly options clearly, which results in frustration and bad 
choices.  
## Problem 2:  
"New customers need a way to trust which products are truly eco-friendly because they fear 
greenwashing, which results in hesitation to buy."   
Research Methods  
• Surveys – to learn how many users care about eco-friendly shopping and what they 
look for.  
• Diary Studies – to follow users as they try to shop for eco-friendly items over a few days.  
# Why?  
Surveys show patterns from many users. Diary studies help you see real behavior and shopping habits over time.
